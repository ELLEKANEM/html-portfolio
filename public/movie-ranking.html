<h1>MY BEST MOVIES ON ROGER EBERT</h1> 
<hr>
<h2>Next level</h2>
<h3>The Color Purple</h3>
<p>Acting, storyline, etc 1000%</p>
<h3>Strangers on a Train</h3>
<p>Great story</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3> 
<p>Just beause I'm a sucker for anime, this was tough to like when I first watched it but when I saw it a second time I loved it</p><hr>
<h2>Close second</h2> 
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Had this DVD at home when I was around 12 but parents never let me watch it and I wondered why, afterall it just looked like a nice looking lady on the cover posing for a picture on the bed fully clothed. Just got around to watch it this year and I'm so glad I did</p> <hr>
<h2>Best Movie</h2> 
<h3>The Hateful Eight</h3>
<p>It was so hard to pick betweeen this and the first runner up because both movies were beautifully made with amazing dialogue and character stories</p>
